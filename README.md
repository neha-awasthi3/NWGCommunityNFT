# Nitrogen Working Group Community Nitrogen Footprint Web-based Tool

This is the web-based tool created using R-Shiny to display the nitrogen footprint for a locality. It will take user input and then show summary graphs, tables, and maps regarding the nitrogen output and sources. In the future, it will also show predicted changes in nitrogen output based on possible changes to local policies.

# Current Capabilities
The tool currently draws from Charlottesville data to produce the summary graphs and tables under the 'Summary' tab.

# Future Improvements
The data inputs currently do not work and the tool automatically draws from Charlottesville data. There is a small discrepency is some of the food calculations. Fertilizer has not been included in the calculations yet. A write up of instructions needs to be added to the 'About' tab. The map and possible changes regarding local nitrogen reduction policies have not been completed yet.
